A try for a pyqt4 mixer for Roland/Edimax UA-100
================================================

Being neither a good programmer, nor a good musician (actually, not even an average one of them), 
I decided anyway to try write a pyQT4 mixer to control the old Roland UA-100.

There was a working one, written in C++ and MOTIF (http://michaelminn.com/linux/mmusbaudio/), 
but it relies on OSS and thus is not working with ALSA.

If anyone is interested in helping, YOU ARE WELCOME! I'd appreciate even corrections or comments on my 
awful coding!
